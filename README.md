Assignment 1:
Create a web server in Go that uses softlayer-go to get the current user's information, the list of virtual servers with their passwords as known by SoftLayer.
So I would go to http://localhost/ and it should print out all that information. Use "text/template" to format the print out.

Assignment 2:
When listing the virtual servers, use object masks and filters to show the owner of each virtual server. Look at how to get that using the relation properties of the virtual server.
